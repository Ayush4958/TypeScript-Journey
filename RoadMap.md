# üõ£Ô∏è TypeScript Roadmap for Beginners

### Phase 1: Getting Started with TypeScript

- Goal: Understand what TypeScript is and how to set it up.
- What is TypeScript?

Differences between TypeScript and JavaScript

Why use TypeScript?

- Setting up TypeScript

Installing Node.js and npm

Install TypeScript globally: npm install -g typescript

Initialize a TS project: tsc --init

- Using VS Code with TypeScript

Your First TypeScript Program

Write a basic .ts file

Compile using tsc filename.ts

Run with Node.js

### Phase 2: TypeScript Fundamentals

- Goal: Learn the core syntax and types.
- Basic Types

number, string, boolean

any, unknown, void, null, undefined

Type annotations

Arrays and Tuples

Typed arrays: number[], string[]

Tuples: [string, number]

- Functions

Function types and return types

Optional and default parameters

Arrow functions with types

- Objects and Type Aliases

Object typing

Type aliases (type keyword)

Interfaces

- Define and use interfaces

Difference between type and interface

Phase 3: Intermediate Concepts

Goal: Use TypeScript in structured applications.

Union and Intersection Types

type A = string | number

type B = A & { age: number }

Type Narrowing

Using typeof, in, instanceof

Type guards

Enums

Numeric and string enums

Generics

Generic functions: <T>(arg: T) => T

Generic types and interfaces

Type Assertion & Type Casting

as keyword

<Type>value syntax

Phase 4: Working with OOP in TypeScript

Goal: Learn object-oriented programming in TypeScript.

Classes and Objects

File-based modules

Advanced Types

Mapped types

Conditional types

Utility types (Partial, Pick, Omit, Record, etc.)

Declaration Files

What are .d.ts files?

Using DefinitelyTyped (@types/...)

Phase 6: TypeScript with Real Projects

Goal: Use TypeScript with common frameworks.

Using TypeScript with Node.js

Setup with Express

tsconfig for Node apps
